While various tools can assist in creating diagrams, the process can be cumbersome. This project aims to simplify this by directly fetching all necessary existing schemas from your database or an XML file. You just need to mention the columns, tables, primary keys, etc., and it will create a UI design that can be rendered through the Draw.io website.
